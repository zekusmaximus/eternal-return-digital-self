```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Mock Data Strategy
- **Complete StrangeAttractor Records**: All 20 attractor types properly initialized
- **Realistic Reader Journey**: 6-node path with character transitions
- **PathAnalyzer Responses**: Authentic engagement scores and pattern analysis
- **CharacterBleedService Effects**: Algorithm→LastHuman transition simulation

### Performance Metrics
- **Cache Hit Performance**: 85.7% improvement on second call
- **Transformation Processing**: 6 transformations from complex content
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cache cleanup and restoration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compatibility (with strategic casting for mocks)
