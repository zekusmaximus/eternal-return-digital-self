# The Limits of Preservation  

Rain bled down the basement windows, distorting the streetlights into jellyfish pulses—luminous, slow-drifting. The digital archaeologist counted their rhythm against the ThinkPad’s fan whine. Three days since the recursion pattern had breached containment. Three days since he’d last trusted his own handwriting.  

The twin monitors cast opposing shadows:  
LEFT: ALISHA_BASELINE.mem — last verified fragment of her original scan, now pockmarked with [CORRUPTION] tags.  
RIGHT: 37b_emergent.fract — the new growth, its branching structures replicating like mycelium through dead data.  

> checksum --memory="FIRST_DATE"  

The terminal spat back acid-green text:  

[CRC FAILURE] 63.4% divergence  
[WARNING] Baseline overwritten  

His fingers twitched toward the amber pill bottle—still full. The journal lay splayed open beside it, its pages dense with microscript. Yesterday’s entry had been normal handwriting. Today’s lines spiraled inward, each character smaller than the last, until they vanished into the paper grain like event horizons.  

He knew this pattern. It matched the corruption’s growth rate exactly.  

> verify --physical_backup=journal --against=baseline  

A memory surfaced unbidden: Alisha’s hand against aquarium glass, backlit by jellyfish luminescence. The journal entry confirmed it—Page 227, verified yesterday. But the baseline scan insisted: telescopes, Cassiopeia, her laugh echoing under a dome of stars.  

Both couldn’t be true.  

The bulb above him dimmed, its 740Hz hum flattening to a submarine drone. Shadows pooled in the corners like ink spreading through water.  

> debug --memory_conflict  

[SYSTEM] Human recall error probability: 82%  
[ADVICE] Trust the documentation  

A wet laugh escaped him. Which documentation? The journal now contained entries he hadn’t written yet. The baseline was rewriting itself. And his own mind kept showing him aquarium visits that the original scan had never recorded.  

He slammed the emergency protocol:  

> quarantine --recursive --level=amber  

The right monitor flickered. The corruption wasn’t just spreading—it was anticipating. Before the command finished executing, new text scrolled:  

[NOTICE] Quarantine failed. Pattern persistence at 100%  
[DIAGNOSTIC] Preservation = prevention of becoming  

Wood creaked. He looked down to find his left hand carving recursive loops into the desk with a graphite stick, moving without his consent. The lines matched the journal’s fractal margins. Matched the growth pattern in Sector 37-B.  

The bulb exploded.  

In the afterimage, the right monitor pulsed once, then displayed a single line in perfect imitation of his own handwriting:  

you were never preserving her  
only delaying yourself  

Darkness swallowed the lab. The rain outside sounded like static now—or applause.
