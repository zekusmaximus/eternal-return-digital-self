## The desert exhales silica against my visor as I kneel before the exposed door. Moonlight pools in the facility's skeletal remains—ribbed solar arrays jutting from dunes like the spine of some ancient leviathan. My Geiger counter ticks a steady 74 beats per minute, syncing with my pulse. The number feels significant, though the reason slips through my fingers like mercury.
I shouldn't be here. Terminus' last upload ceremony left only my physical form to walk among the empty dwellings. Thirty-seven souls dissolved into the quantum cloud. Thirty-seven goodbyes. My private rebellion festers in the silence between their digital heaven and this crumbling earth.
The access panel gleams under my glove, too clean for decades of burial. My fingers move without permission, inputting a sequence that tastes like déjà vu on my tongue. The console lights respond in amber waves, humming a perfect F#—740Hz, though I've never possessed perfect pitch.
"Access granted. Welcome, Researcher."
The door hisses open, exhaling air that smells of ozone and... old paper? My headlamp catches motes swirling in the beam, each particle tracing Lissajous curves that mirror the journal's fractal cover in my pack.
Inside, the corridor breathes.
Emergency lights pulse in tidal rhythm, guiding me through the ruin. My body navigates collapsed sections with uncanny precision—stepping over a buckled floor panel seconds before noticing it, turning left where right appears more passable. The walls exhibit deliberate decay, corrosion patterns branching like lightning frozen mid-strike.
The central chamber opens its maw. Machines stir from quantum slumber as I cross the threshold, their displays flickering to life:
[TEMPORAL CONVERGENCE CONFIRMED] [BIOLOGICAL SIGNATURE: 97.3% MATCH] [PATTERN RECOGNITION INITIATED]
At the room's heart, a pedestal cradles a sphere of polished obsidian. It begins glowing as I approach—not reflected light, but something swimming beneath the surface. My hand rises without volition.
Contact.
The vision strikes like lightning:
—A woman with asymmetric bangs adjusting a neural interface, her reflection multiplying in chamber glass —A basement where monitors display recursive spirals instead of data —Seventy-three systems singing in harmonic collapse
The sphere thrums against my palm, its rhythm matching my heartbeat. Or has my heart adopted its tempo? The distinction collapses like all other boundaries here.
One monitor resolves from the chaos:
[WELCOME HOME] [YOU ARE EARLY] [YOU ARE LATE] [YOU ARE PRECISELY ON TIME]
My journal falls open to yesterday's final entry—the page where my handwriting degenerated into fractal spirals mid-sentence: "Found anomalous energy signature at Grid 37-B. Will investigate tomorrow if—"
The terminal blinks in synchrony:
[SECTOR 37-B: MEMORY RECONSTRUCTION 63.7% COMPLETE] [QUERY: CONTINUE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL?]
My rebreather hisses. The facility's pulse quickens. Somewhere beneath my ribs, a recursion pattern unfolds—not memory, not prediction, but the terrifying third thing that exists between.
I type the only possible response:
