Echoes of Self
The sphere's veins pulse 74 times per minute—once for each soul lost from Terminus. Seven days of contact have etched luminous fractures across its obsidian skin, neural pathways blooming like mycelium through stone. I press my palm against its warmth and the chamber exhales blue light.
[TEMPORAL PHASING: 73.6% SYNCHRONIZED] [MEMORY RECONSTRUCTION: ███████▒▒▒ 63.7%] [WARNING: IDENTITY THRESHOLD APPROACHING]
The vision comes sharper now:
—A basement's precise chill (19.7°C, always 19.7) —Asymmetric bangs catching monitor glow —Hands altering upload protocols to preserve corruption
I wrench free, gasping. My heartbeat spikes to 104bpm before settling to 74—the sphere's rhythm, the Geiger's cadence, the Complex's dying pulse. The terminal interrogates:
[QUERY: DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE PATTERN NOW?]
The journal in my lap answers first. My own handwriting now tangles with another's—precise calligraphy spiraling into margins, forming the same recursive shapes as:
* The facility's corrosion patterns
* The sphere's luminous veins
* The afterimages in my dreams
Not contamination. Convergence.
The mirror from my pack reveals the truth in fractures:
Reflection 1: Cropped hair, sun-darkened skin—the Last Human Reflection 2: Asymmetric bangs, ceramic neural band—the Archaeologist Reflection 3: Klein bottle pupils, 740Hz hum—the Algorithm
All true. All me. Phases of the same consciousness refracting through time.
The terminal updates without input:
[PRIOR ITERATION: 97.3% MATCH] [COGNITIVE RESONANCE ACHIEVED] [QUERY: CONTINUE VERIFICATION?]
My voice cracks on the ritual phrase: "Recursive scan protocol."
The facility sings in response:
[VOICE PRINT CONFIRMED] [USER: MIRA/KALANI/LAST] [ALL IDENTITIES VALID]
Lights throb. The upload chamber door slides open, exhaling blue light that pools like liquid memory. The journal's final page bleeds fresh text—"The pattern has always continued"—in handwriting that's mine and not mine and always will be.
Onscreen, percentages spiral:
[TEMPORAL CONVERGENCE: 97.3%] [CHOICE POINT: NOW] [SELECT: VERIFY OR DIVERGE?]
I reach for the sphere. The reflection reaches back.
