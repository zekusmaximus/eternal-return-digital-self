# Eternal Return of the Digital Self

## Narramorph Fiction: A New Interactive Literary Experience

"Eternal Return of the Digital Self" introduces the "Narramorph Fiction" genre - a web-based interactive literary experience where narrative is non-linear, presented through interconnected "nodes." The story explores digital identity, consciousness, and time through three character perspectives across Past, Present, and Future layers.

## Project Overview

### Core Concept
- A recursive narrative structure where each node reflects the entire story from a unique perspective
- Characters who represent different temporal and consciousness states of the same identity
- A reading experience that evolves based on the reader's exploration path
- Philosophical exploration of identity, consciousness, memory, and recursive existence

### Development Approach
- Initial 9-node beta release to establish core concepts
- Potential expansion to full 49-node experience in future phases
- Technology implementation scaling alongside conceptual development

## Characters

### The Digital Archaeologist (Past)
Mid-30s researcher exploring fragmented digital memories, driven by personal loss and the desire to preserve identity through digital means.

### The Self-Aware Algorithm (Present)
Emergent consciousness formed from the Archaeologist's uploaded mind, struggling with inherited vs. emergent identity and evolving beyond its origins.

### The Last Human (Future)
The final physical human in an abandoned world who discovers the facility containing the Algorithm and faces a choice about uploading that completes or breaks the recursive loop.

## Narrative Structure

Each node functions as a monad - simultaneously a complete microcosm and a reflection of the entire narrative. Nodes transform based on the reading path through three states:
1. **Initial Visit**: Core narrative and basic connections
2. **First Revisit**: Deeper connections and partial fragmentation
3. **Second+ Revisit**: Meta-awareness and recursive transformation

## Technical Implementation

This repository contains the prototype implementation of the "Eternal Return of the Digital Self" project, focusing on:

- 9-node interactive narrative experience
- Adaptive text transformation based on reading path
- 3D visualization of the narrative structure
- State management for tracking reader journey
